### Abstract:

Lion Cavern in Eswatini is the world’s oldest known ochre mine dating back to the Middle Stone Age (MSA). Renewed research has confirmed the proposed antiquity of over 43 000 BP using Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating. The site contains a stratigraphic sequence spanning from the Holocene Late Stone Age (LSA) to the MSA. A neighboring site called Castle Cavern revealed ochre mining during the Early Iron Age. Ochre extraction at both sites required the use of hard tools due to its concreted nature. We identified a large corpus of tools that meet specific technological and morphological requirements for ochre mining, characterized by splintered edges found on one or more ends of the tool. While we were able to identify these tools among other non-mining-related artifacts, traditional lithic analysis methods proved inadequate for their characterization. Here we present a new approach, combining 3D scanning technology with shape and metric analyses, along with a diachronic comparison across the studied sequences. Our results suggest a remarkable continuity in mining tool technology over time, with the main variation being a decrease in tool size, a trend aligning with current understanding of the MSA-to-LSA transition in southern Africa. Marked technological changes are noted only in the Iron Age layers at Castle Cavern. These findings are crucial for discussing technological change, as well as mobility, migration, knowledge transmission and exchange systems in the region.
